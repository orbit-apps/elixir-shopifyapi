## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `shopify_api` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:shopify_api, github: "pixelunion/elixir-shopifyapi", tag: "v0.16.0"}
  ]
end
```

Add it to your phoenix routes.

```elixir
scope "/shop" do
  forward("/", ShopifyAPI.Router)
end
```

To handle incoming webhooks from Shopify, add the `ShopifyAPI.Plugs.Webhook` to your `Endpoint` module (before the JSON parser configuration):

```elixir
plug ShopifyAPI.Plugs.Webhook,
  app_name: "my-app-name",
  prefix: "/shopify/webhook",
  callback: {WebhookHandler, :handle_webhook, []}
```

If you want persisted Apps, Shops, and Tokens add configuration to your functions.
```elixir
config :shopify_api, ShopifyAPI.AuthTokenServer,
  initializer: {MyApp.AuthToken, :init, []},
  persistence: {MyApp.AuthToken, :save, []}
config :shopify_api, ShopifyAPI.AppServer,
  initializer: {MyApp.ShopifyApp, :init, []},
  persistence: {MyApp.ShopifyApp, :save, []}
config :shopify_api, ShopifyAPI.ShopServer,
  initializer: {MyApp.Shop, :init, []},
  persistence: {MyApp.Shop, :save, []}
```

## Installing this app in a Shop

There is a boilerplate repo for quickly getting up and running at [ShopifyApp](https://github.com/pixelunion/elixir-shopify-app)

1. Start something like ngrok
2. Configure your app to allow your ngrok url as one of the redirect_urls
3. Point your browser to `http://localhost:4000/shop/install?shop=your-shop.myshopify.com&app=yourapp` and it should prompt you to login and authorize it.


## Configuration

### API Version

Shopify introduced API versioning here: https://help.shopify.com/en/api/versioning

Configure the version to use in your config.exs, it will default to a stable version as ref'd in the [request module](lib/shopify_api/rest/request.ex).

```elixir
config :shopify_api, ShopifyAPI.REST, api_version: "2019-04"
```

### Supervisor

The ShopifyAPI has three servers for caching commonly-used structs - `AppServer`, `ShopServer`, and `AuthTokenServer`.
These act as a write-through caching layer for their corresponding data structure.

A supervisor `ShopifyAPI.Supervisor` is provided to start up and supervise all three servers.
Add it to your application's supervision tree, and define [hooks for preloading data](#Installation).

NOTE: Make sure you place the supervisor after any dependencies used in preloading the data. (ie Ecto)

Add the following to your application:

```elixir
def start(_type, _args) do
  children = [
    MyApp.Repo,
    ShopifyAPI.Supervisor
  ]

  Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
end
```

## Webhooks

To set up your app to receive webhooks, first you'll need to add `ShopifyAPI.Plugs.Webhook` to your `Endpoint` module:

```elixir
plug ShopifyAPI.Plugs.Webhook,
  app_name: "my-app-name",
  prefix: "/shopify/webhook",
  callback: {WebhookHandler, :handle_webhook, []}
```

You'll also need to define a corresponding `WebhookHandler` module in your app:

```elixir
defmodule WebhookHandler do
  def handle_webhook(app, shop, domain, payload) do
    # TODO implement me!
  end
end
```

And there you go!

Now webhooks sent to `YOUR_URL/shopify/webhook` will be interpreted as webhooks for the `my-app-name` app.
If you append an app name to the URL in the Shopify configuration, that app will be used instead (e.g. `/shopify/webhook/private-app-name`).

If you'd like to install webhooks using ShopifyAPI, we need to do a small bit more work:

```elixir
# Add this to your configuration so that ShopifyAPI knows the webhook prefix.
config :shopify_api, ShopifyAPI.Webhook, uri: "https://your-app-url/shop/webhook"
```

Now once a shop is installed, you can create webhook subscriptions.
This will automatically append your app's name to the generated webhook URL:

```elixir
token = ShopifyAPI.AuthTokenServer.get("shop domain", "app name")

topic = "orders/create"
server_address = ShopifyAPI.REST.Webhook.webhook_uri(token)
webhook = %{topic: topic, address: server_address}

ShopifyAPI.REST.Webhook.create(token, %{webhook: webhook})
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/shopify_api](https://hexdocs.pm/shopify_api).

## GraphQL

`GraphQL` implementation handles GraphQL Queries against Shopify API using HTTPoison library as client, this initial implementation consists of hitting Shopify GraphQL and returning the response in a tuple `{:ok, %Response{}} | {:error, %Response{}}` containing the response and metadata(actualQueryCost, throttleStatus).

Configure the version to use in your config.exs, it will default to a stable version as ref'd in the [graphql module](lib/shopify_api/graphql.ex).


```elixir
config :shopify_api, ShopifyAPI.GraphQL, graphql_version: "2019-07"
```

### GraphQL Response

Because `GraphQL responses` can be a little complex we are parsing/wraping responses `%HTTPoison.response` to `%GraphQL.Response`.

Successful response:

```elixir
{:ok, %ShopifyAPI.GraphQL.Response{response: %{}, metadata: %{}, status_code: code}}
```

Failed response:

```elixir
{:error, %HTTPoison.Response{}}
```

## Telemetry

The `shopify_api` library will emit events using the [`:telemetry`](https://github.com/beam-telemetry/telemetry) library. Consumers of `shopify_api` can then use these events for customized metrics aggregation and more.
The following telemetry events are generated:
- `[:shopify_api, :rest_request, :success]`
- `[:shopify_api, :rest_request, :failure]`
- `[:shopify_api, :throttling, :over_limit]`
- `[:shopify_api, :throttling, :within_limit]`
- `[:shopify_api, :graphql_request, :success]`
- `[:shopify_api, :graphql_request, :failure]`
- `[:shopify_api, :bulk_operation, :success]`
- `[:shopify_api, :bulk_operation, :failure]`

As an example, you could use an external module to instrument API requests made by `shopify_api`:

```elixir
defmodule Instrumenter do
  def setup do
    events = [
      [:shopify_api, :rest_request, :success],
      [:shopify_api, :rest_request, :failure]
    ]

    :telemetry.attach_many("my-instrumenter", events, &handle_event/4, nil)
  end

  def handle_event([:shopify_api, :rest_request, :success], measurements, metadata, _config) do
    # Ship success events
  end
end```
